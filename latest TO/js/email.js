// ==============================================================
//  APPROVAL EMAIL NOTIFICATION (requester notification)
//  When a superadmin approves a resolution, the requester gets an
//  automated email from the BUSINESS Gmail account telling them to
//  check the portal with their ticket number.
//
//  The browser cannot speak SMTP (no raw sockets), so the message is
//  handed to a Google Apps Script Web App bridge which sends it with
//  the business Gmail account and verifies — SERVER-SIDE — that the
//  caller is really a signed-in superadmin before sending anything.
//
//  Deploy: docs/apps-script/RCMS-Ticket-Notifier.gs
//  Setup : docs/EMAIL-SETUP.md
//
//  Everything here is best-effort: an approval must never be blocked,
//  cancelled or rolled back because an email could not be sent.
// ==============================================================

// Apps Script answers from script.googleusercontent.com without CORS headers,
// so the request is opaque — one fire-and-forget attempt, never a retry here
// (a retry could double-send). Delivery is verified from the business Gmail
// "Sent" folder plus the `approvalEmail` record kept on the ticket.
//
// 45s (not 15s): the FIRST call after a deployment is slow — Apps Script spins
// up the container, the redirect to script.googleusercontent.com has to be
// followed, and the very first Gmail send can trigger a one-time scope check.
// A 15s ceiling aborted those perfectly good requests ("signal is aborted
// without reason") and looked like a total failure.
