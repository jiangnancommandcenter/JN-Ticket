// ==============================================================
//  HR <-> SUPERADMIN CHAT  (one conversation per pair)
//  Floating chat button (top-right) that opens a chat modal with a
//  conversation list on the left and the selected thread on the right.
//
//  ⚠️⚠️ TWO DIFFERENT ROLE SETS — DO NOT COLLAPSE THEM INTO ONE.
//
//  1:1 CONVERSATIONS: HR, superadmin and the AREA MANAGER (stored role
//  'owner'). An Area Manager may open a private thread with any HR and with
//  any superadmin, but NOT with another Area Manager — the pairing rule is
//  "both chat-eligible AND a different role", so managers simply never pair
//  with each other. Operators and unknown roles are excluded entirely.
//
//  THE "All HR" GROUP CHAT: HR and superadmin ONLY. An Area Manager is a full
//  chat participant yet is deliberately NOT in the group — they never see the
//  row, and firestore.rules denies the room itself.
//
//  Enforced in three places:
//    1. canChat(role) / isStartable() / inGroupRoom()  — pure gates, unit-tested
//    2. ChatService.init()                            — hides/removes the launcher
//    3. firestore.rules   — isChatRole() for 1:1, isHrOrSuperAdmin() for the
//                            group, isChatMember() for privacy, isAreaManager()
//                            for the roster read
//
//  HR, Area Manager and superadmin share the SAME dashboard
//  (ownerdashboard.html); the role differs in the profile label, in chat
//  access and in the +Ticket shortcut. The superadmin assigns the role from
//  the User Approvals tab.
//
//  Data model:
//    chats/{chatId}              { type, members[], title, lastMessage,
//                                   lastMessageAt, lastSenderEmail }
//    chats/{chatId}/messages/{m} { text, senderEmail, senderName, sentAt }
//    chats/owner-superadmin/profiles/{k}
//                                 { email, role, displayName, title }
//                                   <- the people directory
//
//  ONE ROOM PER PAIR. There is one conversation per PAIR of participants, NOT
//  a single shared room: previously every HR and every superadmin read and
//  wrote the one room `owner-superadmin`, so with several HR accounts
//  everybody saw everybody's messages. The room id is derived from the two
//  participants' emails (see dmRoomIdFor), so both sides compute the same id
//  with no lookup and no extra document.
//
//  ⚠️ THE AREA MANAGER ROLE NEEDS A RULES DEPLOY
//  (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`). The 1:1 and roster rules were
//  widened to isChatRole() / isAreaManager(); until they are deployed an Area
//  Manager sees the chat circle but every read and write is denied. The
//  launcher then greys out and names the fix (see disableChatWithReason), so
//  it fails visibly rather than silently.
//
//  ⚠️ The people directory and the room doc still need NO new rule: the
//  directory reuses the deployed `profiles` subcollection and the room doc uses
//  only the field keys the deployed `hasOnly()` allowlist permits. The
//  conversation list deliberately omits `orderBy` (an `array-contains`
//  + `orderBy` combination would need a paid composite index). Unread is
//  tracked in localStorage. See the CONVERSATION LIST block for details.
//
//  Loaded on main.html (superadmin) and ownerdashboard.html
//  (Area Manager + HR + superadmin). Uses the Firebase v8 compat SDK already
//  initialised by firebase.js (global `db` / `auth`).

     * Who may MENTION a violation report in chat. HR and superadmin ONLY.
     *
     * ⚠️ AN AREA MANAGER (stored role 'owner') IS EXCLUDED, and this is a
     * deliberate, separate decision from the group chat — the two role sets are
     * NOT the same and must not be collapsed into one.
     *
     * The reason is written down in ownerdashboard.html: violations are CCTV
     * evidence, and an Area Manager "must never see CCTV violation data".
     * js/hr-violations.js already enforces that by hiding the whole Violations
     * tab (applyRole() allows only 'hr' and 'superadmin'), and firestore.rules
     * denies the read. Chat was the ONE surface that ignored it:
     *
     *   - linkifyViolationRefs() is a PURE REGEX over the sender's own text, so
     *     it needed no read and no permission — an Area Manager typing
     *     "violation VIO-0007" got a real, clickable chip written into the
     *     message. The rules stopped them RESOLVING it, but the chip existed
     *     and the recipient clicked into a wall.
     *   - "@violation" opened a picker whose read was denied, so it always
     *     came up empty and showed "No reports have been transferred to HR
     *     yet" — a message written for HR, shown to someone who by design can
     *     never transfer anything.
     *
     * ⚠️ AN ALLOWLIST, NOT A DENYLIST, for the same reason CHAT_ALLOWED_ROLES is
     * one: a new or unknown role must never inherit this capability by
     * accident. Must stay in lockstep with applyRole() in js/hr-violations.js.
     *
     * ⚠️ TICKETS ARE NOT AFFECTED. A ticket is the Area Manager's own sign-off
     * work — they have a whole tickets table for their branches — so @ticket
     * stays available to every chat role. Only violations are restricted.

    /**
     * Load the AUTHORITATIVE account roster (the `users` collection) — for
     * BOTH chat roles, and LIVE.
     *
     * ⚠️ WHICH PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. The directory
     * (`chats/owner-superadmin/profiles`) is SELF-PUBLISHED: a person gets an
     * entry only once they have opened the chat and saved a profile, and the
     * `role` in that entry is whatever was current at that moment. So a
     * brand-new HR who has never opened the chat is missing from the
     * superadmin's list entirely, a brand-new SUPERADMIN is missing from every
     * HR's list, and an entry written before the role was known (`role: ''`)
     * is filtered out by isStartable() — together those are "I cannot message
     * the new account".
     *
     * The role the app actually authorises on is `users/{email}.role`: the
     * rules read it to decide who may use the chat at all, and the dashboard
     * writes it when an account is approved or re-roled — so `users` knows an
     * account the moment it is registered, while the directory knows it only
     * once its owner shows up. That is why the roster, not the directory, is
     * what has to carry both directions of the list.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE TWO SIDES READ DIFFERENTLY, BECAUSE THE RULES DO:
     *
     *   superadmin → `allow read: if isSuperAdmin() || isSelf()` — the WHOLE
     *                collection (script.js loadSuperadminUsers() already does
     *                exactly that in production), deliberately WITHOUT a
     *                `where()`: no index on the free plan, and it survives a
     *                role stored with stray case or whitespace ('HR', ' hr '),
     *                which an equality filter would silently miss.
     *   hr         → `allow read: if isHrOrSuperAdmin() && resource.data.role
     *                == 'superadmin'` — per-document, so it is provable only
     *                for a query filtered the same way. Hence the ONE
     *                `where()` below; an unfiltered HR read would be denied.
     *                It cannot miss anyone, because chat access itself is
     *                granted by the case-sensitive `role in ['hr',
     *                'superadmin']`, so every account that may chat already
     *                stores the lowercase value.
     *
     * ⚠️ LIVE, NOT ONE-SHOT. A single `.get()` answered only for the device
     * that asked, at mount: an account approved on somebody else's machine —
     * or while this page was open — stayed invisible until a reload.
     * `onSnapshot` is what makes "a newly registered account appears" true on
     * every screen with no refresh (the roster is still re-subscribed by
     * ChatService.refreshDirectory() right after an approval, which is when
     * script.js already calls it).
     *
     * ⚠️ IT IS A CONVENIENCE, NEVER A PERMISSION. A denied/failed roster read
     * is reported once and degrades to the directory: people then appear as
     * soon as they publish a profile, and the chat never greys itself out.

     * `{ text, senderEmail, senderName, senderRole, sentAt }`; `mentions` and
     * `replyTo` came later, and the rules in this repository put NO allowlist
     * on message fields, so nothing here ever needed one. If the deployed rule
     * does carry a `hasOnly()` allowlist from that older era, the extra keys
     * are refused and the message never saves — which is exactly
     * "[Chat] Failed to send message: Missing or insufficient permissions",
     * with the room write above it SUCCEEDING (which is the tell: a room and a
     * message in the same batch fail together, so one passing and one failing
     * means the refusal is specific to the message document).
     *
     * So the full payload goes first (keeping mentions and replies) and, only
     * if the rules refuse it, sendMessage() retries the identical message with
     * the five documented fields. Nothing is lost that cannot be derived:
     * mentions are recomputed from the text, and `senderRole` is read from the
     * profile anyway.
     *
     * ⚠️ `senderEmail` IS THE MODULE'S OWN LOWERCASED ADDRESS (`me`, which is
     * `String(currentUserEmail).toLowerCase()`, and `currentUserEmail` itself
     * was stored lowercased by init()). It is written explicitly rather than
     * reused from the auth object because the create rule is
     * `request.resource.data.senderEmail == selfEmail()` and `selfEmail()` is
     * `request.auth.token.email.lower()`: the two must be compared in the SAME
     * case, and the moment anyone "simplifies" this back to
     * `auth.currentUser.email` the comparison silently becomes case-sensitive
     * again. It is the same value today, deliberately.

    //  ⚠️ WHY THE REFERENCE LIVES IN THE MESSAGE TEXT AND NOT IN A FIELD.
    //  It could have been a `ticketRefs: [...]` array on the message doc, but
    //  the messages rule deliberately has NO `hasOnly()` allowlist
    //  (firestore.rules, `match /messages`) — unlike rooms, reactions and
    //  receipts, which each pin an exact key list. So a new field would be
    //  permitted... but sendMessage() is written defensively against DEPLOYED
    //  rules that may be OLDER than this client, and it already falls back to
    //  a reduced payload when a write is refused. Keeping the reference
    //  inside `text` means:
    //    * no schema change, and nothing to deploy,
    //    * a message sent BEFORE this feature existed still renders a working
    //      link, because the words are already in the text,
    //    * no new field can trip an old hasOnly() and silently stop saving.
    //  The chip is therefore built at RENDER time only — nothing about a
    //  ticket reference is ever persisted.
