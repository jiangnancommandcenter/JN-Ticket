// ===========================================================================
//  THE LIVE COUNTDOWN
//
//  The manager reads the report inside the modal while the window drains, so the
//  clock has to be VISIBLE there and not just in the Access column — a countdown
//  they can only see by closing the modal is a countdown nobody is looking at.
//
//  Three things this pins that are easy to get subtly wrong:
//
//  1. THE TICKER EDITS TEXT IN PLACE. It must NOT call renderOwnerTickets() on a
//     timer. That would rebuild every row each second, restart the interval from
//     inside its own callback, blow away focus and any open dropdown, and re-sort
//     the table under the manager's cursor. The table is re-rendered on exactly
//     one event: something actually expiring.
//
//  2. URGENCY IS A FRACTION OF THE WINDOW, NOT ABSOLUTE SECONDS. A fixed
//     "under 10 minutes" rule makes every second of the time-compressed 1-minute
//     test window red, and would never fire once on a real 2-day window. The
//     total is carried on the node as data-window-ms for this reason.
//
//  3. AT ZERO THE MODAL IS RE-DERIVED. The payload must stop being shown the
//     moment the window closes — that is the entire intent of the feature, and a
//     countdown ticking to 0:00 over a still-readable report would be worse than
//     no countdown at all.
//
//  Run: npm test
