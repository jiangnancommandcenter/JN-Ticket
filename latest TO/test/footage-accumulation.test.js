// splitApprovalAttachments() derives the manager's half as "every attachment
// whose key is NOT in the operator list", so the orphaned originals fell
// through and rendered under "Manager's Request" — CCTV the operator captured,
// presented as if the manager had filed it.

//     first — and an unfiltered chats.get() is REFUSED for a superadmin, because
//     the read rule is membership-based (canReadChat). That produced
//     "Missing or insufficient permissions" and aborted the run.
// (2) The obvious "fix" — adding `isSuperAdmin() ||` to the chats READ rule —
//     works, and is WRONG: a room doc carries `lastMessage`, so it would expose
//     the last line of every private 1:1 conversation. test/chat-rules.test.js
//     caught it and it was reverted.
// The correct answer is that room ids are DETERMINISTIC, so they can be computed
// from `users` (which a superadmin already reads) and deleted blind.
